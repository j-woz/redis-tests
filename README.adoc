= redis-tests

Prototyping Redis functionality on relevant computing systems for ExaEpi.

== Polaris case

The idea here is that the user installs a personal Redis.  Then for each run:

. Launches the DB server on the login node
. Launches the compute jobs (via Merlin?), all of which have access to the DB
. When the compute job is completing, one of the jobs will use the Redis client to issue the shutdown command
. On an error, the user will have to interactively shutdown the DB
. The data will be persisted for future runs or analysis

=== Installation
